        <p>An Indian Air Force Tejas fighter jet crashed during a flying display at the Dubai Airshow 2025 on Friday (November 21, 2025) claiming the life of the pilot.

        <p>Pharmacogenomics examines how genetic variations affect an individual’s response to medications, determining whether a drug will be effective, ineffective, or even dangerous for a particular person. Unlike traditional medicine’s one-size-fits-all approach, this field recognises that genetic differences can dramatically alter how our bodies metabolise and respond to drugs. Mostly, this variability arises from differences in drug-metabolising enzymes, particularly the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family, which processes approximately 75% of commonly-prescribed medications.</p>

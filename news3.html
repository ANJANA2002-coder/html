    <h1><b>Pharmacogenomics:reading genes to tailoring prescriptions for individuals</b></h1>
    <p><b>Unlike traditional medicine’s one-size-fits-all approach, the field of pharmacogenomics recognises that genetic differences can dramatically alter how our bodies metabolise and respond to drugs. It represents a fundamental shift in how we think about drug therapy from treating populations to treating individuals, from reactive care to proactive prevention, from trial-and-error to precision medication</b></p>
    <p>

The old medical advice to “start low and go slow” reflects a fundamental challenge in healthcare: the same drug at the same dose can heal one patient while harming another. For decades, physicians have prescribed medications based on population averages, essentially conducting a trial-and-error experiment with each patient. Today, pharmacogenomics is rewriting this script by revealing how our genes influence drug response, transforming medication prescribing from guesswork to  precision.</p>
<p>Pharmacogenomics examines how genetic variations affect an individual’s response to medications, determining whether a drug will be effective, ineffective, or even dangerous for a particular person. Unlike traditional medicine’s one-size-fits-all approach, this field recognises that genetic differences can dramatically alter how our bodies metabolise and respond to drugs. Mostly, this variability arises from differences in drug-metabolising enzymes, particularly the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family, which processes approximately 75% of commonly-prescribed medications.

<p>Adverse Drug Reaction conveys little of the horror of a severe negative reaction to a prescribed drug. But such negative reactions can nonetheless occur. A 1998 study of hospitalized patients published in the Journal of the American Medical Association reported that in 1994, adverse drug reactions accounted for more than 2.2 million serious cases and over 100,000 deaths, making adverse drug reactions (ADRs) one of the leading causes of hospitalization and death in the United States [6]. For instance, the daily doses required to treat patients vary by 20-fold for the warfarin, by 40-fold for the antihypertensive drug propranolol and by 60-fold for L-dopa for parkinsons disease</p>

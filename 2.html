    <p> Wikipedia mentions <blockquote>India's climate is predominantly tropical monsoon, characterized by a seasonal reversal of winds and distinct seasons: winter (December–February), summer (March–June), monsoon (June–September), and post-monsoon (October–November). The Himalayas to the north and the Indian Ocean to the south create a unique climate, making southern parts of the country warmer and more humid, while coastal areas have milder temperatures compared to the continental interior. 
Main climate characteristics
Tropical Monsoon: The climate is shaped by seasonal wind reversals. Winds blow from the southwest in the summer, bringing heavy rainfall, and from the northeast in the winter, bringing drier weather.
Regional Variations: Because India is a vast country with diverse geography, there are significant regional differences.
Coastal areas: Experience more moderate temperatures and less variation between day and night due to the moderating effect of the sea.
Interior regions: Have more extreme climates with very hot summers and cold winters, as seen in cities like Delhi and Amritsar.
Peninsular India: Being closer to the equator, the southern parts have high temperatures year-round.
Himalayan region: Experiences very cold winters and relatively cooler summers. 
The four main seasons
Winter: (December to early April)
Summer: (April to June)
Monsoon: (June to September)
Post-monsoon: (October to December)

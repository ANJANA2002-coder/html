    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <p>Human origin is rooted in Africa, where modern humans, or Homo sapiens, evolved approximately 200,000 to 300,000 years ago from earlier human ancestors. The widely supported "Out of Africa" model explains that after evolving in Africa, Homo sapiens later migrated to other parts of the world, replacing or interbreeding with other early human species like Neanderthals and Denisovans. Evidence for human origins includes fossils found across the African continent, as well as in sites around the globe, which trace the evolutionary path from early hominins to modern humans</p>

<h2>Early Human Ancestors</h2>
<p>Early hominins: The earliest human relatives lived in Africa between 7 and 4.4 million years ago. They shared a common ancestor with chimpanzees and showed a mix of ape-like and human-like traits, such as beginning to walk on two legs. 
Homo erectus: This species lived around 2 million to 1.8 million years ago. They were among the first to migrate out of Africa, into both Asia and Europe. 
Homo heidelbergensis: This group, which lived around 600,000 years ago, is believed to be the common ancestor of both Neanderthals (in Europe) and Denisovans (in Asia), and also the precursor to Homo sapiens (in Africa).

<h2>Legacy and Relationships</h2>
<p>Interbreeding: As Homo sapiens migrated across the globe, they encountered and interbred with other human species, such as Neanderthals and Denisovans. This is why most people today have a small percentage of Neanderthal or Denisovan DNA in their genome. 
Other human species: For much of history, multiple human species lived at the same time. Today, Homo sapiens is the only surviving human species. </p>

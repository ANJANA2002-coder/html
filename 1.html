    <h1>Humans</h1>
    <p>Humans, or Homo sapiens, are a species of primate characterized by advanced intelligence, bipedalism (walking on two legs), and complex language. As social and tool-using animals, humans have spread across the globe and are distinguished by their large brains, capable of abstract reasoning, emotions, and creativity. The species originated in Africa around 300,000 years ago and has evolved significantly, with modern humans showing a lighter skeletal build and a distinct, high-vaulted skull.
